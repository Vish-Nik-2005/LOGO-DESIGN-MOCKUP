#DESCRIPTION:My domain is UI/UX design, and my first task was creating a logo design mockup. I designed the logo using Figma, ensuring it aligned with the appâ€™s theme and user experience guidelines. To maintain proper documentation and version control, I uploaded the design files to a shared workspace, along with multiple variations of the logo for feedback and iteration. This task helped me understand the importance of visual identity in app development and how design choices impact brand perception. Working in Figma allowed me to leverage collaborative design tools efficiently, and by organizing everything in a structured manner, I ensured easy access, revisions, and improvements for future development.
